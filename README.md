# Visual Analysis of the [Customer Shopping](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset/data) Latest Trends Dataset


The client wants to establish a online storefront, as well as run a successful ad campaign. In this analysis, we will determine the following:

- Which U.S. state should we target with ads?
- What time of year is best to run ads?
- What to sell in the storefront?
- What can we do to help customers feel comfortable purchasing items on our online storefront?


First, let's analyze which U.S. state we should target with ads. Our initial idea is to look at where the most expensive purchases on average are coming from.

It looks like Arizona and Pennsylvania stand out as the states in which the most expensive purchases on average are coming from. Let's see if there is any geographical correlation between these areas:

It appears that there is no geographical correlation between states with the most expensive purchases on average. This is a good insight, but doesn't help us determine any of our key points. Let's regroup.

Upon further review of our data and it's structure, we've determined that avg. purchase amount may not necessarily indicated where the most money to be made is. Let's take a look at a different metric: Total Sales. This accounts for the fact that a large amount of smaller purchases can overtake the importance of a few expensive purchases.

It looks like Montana is the state that has the highest Total Sales in the U.S.. Montana is the state where the consumers are willing to spend the most amount of money on goods. Therefore, our ad campaign is likely to be more successful if advertised to people in Montana.

Next, let's see which time of the year would be beneficial to run ads during.

Wintertime is the season during which the most amount of money is being spent by consumers in Montana. This might be caused by the presence of the holiday season. We can conclude that the best time of year to run ads for the storefront is during the winter.

Let's get an idea of what consumers in Montana are buying during the winter:

It appears that consumers in Montana are focusing their purchasing power on clothing during the winter season. It would be a good idea to make sure that we have clothing, as well as an assortment of accessories available in the storefront.

Lastly, let's visit how we can help customers feel comfortable buying items in our storefront. One way we could do this is by ensuring that we have the consumer's primary method of payment available.

By far, Bank Transfer is the primary method of payment by consumers in Montana, during the winter season. It would be wise to include a Bank Transfer functionality on the storefront. This might help customers feel inclined to complete their purchases.

With these insights in mind, we have reason to believe that the client should establish a storefront that sells clothing and accessories. The storefront should include a bank transfer functionality to encourage customers to finish their purchases. The ad campaign is likely to be successful if it is ran during the wintertime, and is targeted at consumers in Montana.
